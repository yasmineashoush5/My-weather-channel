# My-weather-channel
I built a weather dashboard that runs dynamically in the browser. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used the 5-day weather forecast to retrieve weather data for cities. And I used local storage to store my data.
And the weather dashboard work as follows: when  I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed. So this dashboard helps you check the weather and plan your trip accordingly.
